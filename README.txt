# Here is where I define my explanation for how I did the deployment. 

1. Under the deployments directory, I created two files, a service.yaml and a deployment.yaml 
which exposed the service via HTTP and deployed the image to ECR respectively. 

2. Wrote the Dockerfile.

3. Modified the GitHub Actions test and deployment workflow files.

4. Added sonarqube scanner to unit tests and logic to run tests
